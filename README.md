StarWarsMovies 

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a simple api call to fetch
data from a public API 'https://swapi.dev/api/films/' and display its content
on the browser.

Project demonstrated the following:

1. Using useState() to perform first time invocation of the api on page first load. 
Subsequent data fetch is invoke by user interaction.

2. Using useCallback() in memory function to speed up app performance as data fetch 
function is called frequently.

3. Error handling is wrapped around api call to handle errors.

4. Asynchronous API invocation.
